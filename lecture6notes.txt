Lecture 6- Parallel Computing

Moore's Law- reaching material limits
    -need to come up with more efficient processing
    
Certain tasks harder in parallelism
    -E.g.: print to screen
        -Can't control which process finishes first
        
As you add more processors, communication between the processors must occur 
    -i.e.: communication is not parallelizable
   
Use tuples to import many values into a function, and unpack them within a function
    -ex: <args>
        -could have position, velocity, mass, time step, etc
